= Block Macro Processor

A block macro is a block having a content like this: `gist::mygithubaccount/8810011364687d7bec2c[]`.
During the rendering process of the document Asciidoctor invokes a BlockMacroProcessor that has to create a block computed from this macro.

The structure is always like this:

. Macro name, e.g. `gist`
. Two colons `::`
. A target, `mygithubaccount/8810011364687d7bec2c`
. Attributes, that are empty in this case, `[]`

Our example block macro should embed the GitHub gist that would be available at the URL \https://gist.github.com/mygithubaccount/8810011364687d7bec2c.

The following block macro processor replaces such a macro with the `<script>` element that you can also pick from \https://gist.github.com for a certain gist.

----
<1> The `@Name` annotation defines the macro name this BlockMacroProcessor should be called for.
In this case this instance will be called for all block macros that have the name `gist`.
<2> All BlockMacroProcessors must extend the class `org.asciidoctor.extension.BlockMacroProcessor`.
<3> A BlockMacroProcessor must implement the abstract method `process` that is called by Asciidoctor.
The method must return a new block that is used be Asciidoctor instead of the block containing the block macro.
<4> The implementation constructs the HTML content that should go into the final HTML document.
That means that the content has to be directly passed through into the result.
Having said that this example does not work when generating PDF content.
<5> The processor creates a new block via the inherited method `createBlock()`.
The parent of the new block, a context and the content must be passed.
As we want to pass through the content directly into the result the context must be `pass` and the content is the computed HTML string.

NOTE: There are many more methods available to create any type of AST node.

Now, once it is registered, we would be able to use the new block macro in our document as:

== Attributes and Positional attributes

As a next step for the gist macro we might want to add support for GitLab Snippets, which are a similar system to Github Gists.
The property whether we want to embed a Github Gist or a GitLab Snippet can be passed as the first attribute to the macro.

GitLab Snippets can also be part of a project.
This project could be accepted as a second attribute.

That way Gists or Snippets could be embedded with our macro with these AsciiDoc block macros:

.gist-marco-attributes.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
----
include::example$gist-macro-attributes.adoc[]
----

The first macro shows our original notation for how to embed a Github Gist.

The second macro shows how to embed a Snippet from GitLab that is not associated with a project.

The third macro shows how to embed a Snippet from GitLab that is associated with the project `gitlab-org/gitlab-foss`.

The last macro shows how to embed a Snippet from GitLab that is associated with the project `gitlab-org/gitlab-foss` by not using a positional attribute, but instead naming it explicitly.

This can be achieved by the following extension:

.GistBlockMacroPositionalAttributesProcessor
[source,java]
----
include::example$org/asciidoctor/integrationguide/extension/GistBlockMacroPositionalAttributesProcessor.java[tag=include]
----
<1> The positional attributes for this are `provider` and `repo` in that order.
These attributes can be either passed by their position, or by name.
<2> Based on the values of the two attributes the HTML content to embed the Gist is computed.
